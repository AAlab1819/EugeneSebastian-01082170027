For the first problem the program is split to two functions, the main function
which holds all the inputs where the task is then carried out
in the Sack() function. 
The Sack() function uses a K[][] array that calculates and stores the
total value for the output. The program finds how to maximize the value per weight of a person which is then
summed and returned.
